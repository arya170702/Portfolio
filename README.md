To run this file I would suggest to have Visual Studio Code installed in the computer system.
In Visual Studio code install the extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey.
Now after opening the file there will be an Go Live button at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code Interface. 
CLick on it and get redirected to your default browser and the website will open.
Thank You.
